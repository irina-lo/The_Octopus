Welcome to "The Octopus" - my first GitHub project.
This project was created to demonstrate my skills that I acquired during the course "FEWD" of Code Louisville.

This project contains next features:

1. CSS:

1.2. I used Flexbox and media queries to organize images inside the gallery.html;

1.3. I used pseudo classes :before and :after for creation my own checkbox and :hover for changing color of the button ("Contact us");

1.4. responsive navigation menu (UNCOMPLETE);

1.5.

2.1 validation of the name and the email fields;
