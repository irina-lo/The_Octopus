# The_Octopus
Welcome to "The Octopus" - my first GitHub project.
This project was created to demonstrate my skills that I acquired during the course "Code Louisville".

This project contains:

1. media queries (approach "Mobile First"):

   I used it for re-aligning my columns inside the index and menu files, changing the location of the pictures inside the gallery file and making some other visiable changes in the project;

2. responsive navigation menu (UNCOMPLETE);

3. "Contact Us" form (UNCOMPLETE);

4. 

5.

6.


Disclaimer: all photos were taken from open sources purely for filling my project with some content and demonstration my skills like a WEB-developer.
